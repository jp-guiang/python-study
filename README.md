# python-study
This repository contains all my work while learning Python.

I am currently following Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course.

So far I have completed two lectures worth of material:

  - Functions and variables
  - Conditionals

In the files you will find that I have written the same function multiple times, but after each iteration they are refactored to be more concise.

This repository does not contain the problem sets for the topics at hand, as they are located in a separated private repository which Harvard manages.
